The first step before running the codes is to install hyperspectal library of MATLAB which is in the folder "hyperspectralinstallation".

the LIBSVM is downloaded and needs to be installed and used as it is written in its readme file.

data of indian_pines and pavia with their ground truth are downloaded and put in the main folder.

the code written in questions1to8Indianpines.m answers the question number 1 to 8 for the indian_pines dataset. 

the code written in questions1to8pavia.m answers the question number 1 to 8 for the pavia dataset. 

the code written in questions1to8pavia.m answers the question number 9 for the indian_pines dataset. 

the code written in plotfor9question.m answers the question number 9 for the pavia dataset.
